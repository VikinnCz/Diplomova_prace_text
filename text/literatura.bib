    abstract = "{Timbre is a set of auditory attributes that has been characterized through multidimensional scaling of dissimilarity ratings. Acoustic correlates of the resulting dimensions of timbre space provide clues to its sensory representation. Timbre space serves as a psychological model that can predict other aspects of timbre such as the perception of timbre intervals and the role of timbre-related acoustic cues in auditory stream segregation. Timbre also serves as a sensory vehicle for the identity of sound sources. Dimensions of timbre such as roughness provide the sensory basis of more complex musical structuring such as the creation of movement between states of tension and relaxation, both in musical harmony, but also in orchestration. The close link between auditory grouping processes and emergent timbral properties of musical textures demonstrate the range of perceptual variation that can be covered through orchestration techniques and confirm timbre’s role as a structuring force in music perception.}",
