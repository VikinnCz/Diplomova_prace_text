    abstract = "{Timbre is a set of auditory attributes that has been characterized through multidimensional scaling of dissimilarity ratings. Acoustic correlates of the resulting dimensions of timbre space provide clues to its sensory representation. Timbre space serves as a psychological model that can predict other aspects of timbre such as the perception of timbre intervals and the role of timbre-related acoustic cues in auditory stream segregation. Timbre also serves as a sensory vehicle for the identity of sound sources. Dimensions of timbre such as roughness provide the sensory basis of more complex musical structuring such as the creation of movement between states of tension and relaxation, both in musical harmony, but also in orchestration. The close link between auditory grouping processes and emergent timbral properties of musical textures demonstrate the range of perceptual variation that can be covered through orchestration techniques and confirm timbre’s role as a structuring force in music perception.}",

abstract="Advances in the science and technology of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems and algorithms are dependent on the development of rigorous measures of accuracy and performance such that meaningful comparisons among current and novel approaches can be made. This is the motivating principle driving the efforts of the International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory (IMIRSEL) and the annual Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX). Since it started in 2005, MIREX has fostered great advancements not only in many specific areas of MIR, but also in our general understanding of how MIR systems and algorithms are to be evaluated. This chapter outlines some of the major highlights of the past four years of MIREX evaluations, including its organizing principles, the selection of evaluation metrics, and the evolution of evaluation tasks. The chapter concludes with a brief introduction of how MIREX plans to expand into the future using a suite of Web 2.0 technologies to automated MIREX evaluations.",
